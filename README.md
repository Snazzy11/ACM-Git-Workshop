# ACM Git Workshop

## Project Overview

This is a collection of simple Python programs with intentional bugs and incomplete features. Your mission: work together to fix bugs, add features, and learn git along the way!

## What's Inside

- `calculator.py` - A simple calculator with some bugs to fix
- `game.py` - A number guessing game that needs debugging
- `utils.py` - Utility functions (some work, some don't!)
- `members/` - Add your signature here to leave your mark

## Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, you'll know how to:
- Clone a repository
- Commit changes
- Create and merge branches
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Use pull requests
- Collaborate with others using git

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your computer
- A GitHub account
- Python 3.6+

```

## Challenges

### Contributing

2. Commit and push your changes
3. Create a pull request

### Using git to fix bugs
1. Find and fix the bugs in `calculator.py`
2. Test your fixes
